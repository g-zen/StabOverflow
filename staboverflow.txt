---- [User] STORIES ----

1. [User] GETs / and sees landing page with recent questions.

2. Previous [User] clicks "log in" button (direct to /login), authenticates, session starts, becomes either [Student] or [Admin], directed to "/" on success ("/login" on fail)

3. [User] types free text query into nav search bar, query POSTed to "/search", receives search results page with question links relevant to that query

4. [User] types query into search bar on search page, POSTed to "/search" and results rendered

5. Having searched ("/search"), [User] selects a filter from either of the two filter types:
	- Category filters: select a class to limit questions to (CSP, HDS ...)
	- Question type filter: "All" or "Unanswered"
and submits the query again, now with filters (perhaps query is automatically resubmitted on filter change)

6. From landing page, [User] clicks "Browse Questions", this POSTs a blank query to "/search" and renders result

7. [User] GETs "/users/:id", a user profile is rendered (username, name, bio, image, ...) with (optional) questions they've asked

--------------- Database Schema ---------------

TABLE posts
	uid
	question_uid	// which question post does this post relate to
	type_uid		// question or answer
	category_uid	// which class (if any)
	creation_date	// when created
	owner_uid		// id of poster
	owner_name		// display name (for speed)
	answer_count	// so can check if unanswered
	upvotes			// for ordering
	title			// meat of the question
	body			// question body, markdown

TABLE comments
	uid
	parent_uid		// id of immediate parent (either question or answer)
	question_uid	// which question ultimately does this comment relate to
	body			// body of question (maybe markdown)
	creation_date	// when created
	owner_uid		// id of poster
	owner_name		// display name

TABLE tags
	uid
	tag				// what is the tag ("recursion", "nodejs", ...)
	post_uid		// which question was it tagged on 

TABLE post_types
	uid
	name			// is a post a "Question" or an "Answer"

TABLE categories
	uid
	name			// "CSP", "HDS", "HSE", ...

TABLE users
	uid
	full_name
	bio
	email
	isAdmin

// used to verify first-logins (maybe not)
TABLE pending_accounts
	uid
	code	// unique code sent in confirmation email
	email	// "students.stab.org" email that attempted to log in

--------------- Searching ---------------

	- search functionality can utilize the tags attached to a question to determine its relevance to free text queries
	- filters will be either be specified in the query or sent in the request
		- filter by categories by checking a post's category_uid
		- check if unanswered by accessing answer_count

--------------- Authentication ---------------

	- Valid emails: "students.stab.org" or "stab.org"
	- Use confirmation email to verify legitimate email
	- on login, if no user exists, have them enter data (full name, username, ...)

First login procedure:

CONFIRMATION EMAIL IDEA:
	- if email is a (previously unseen) "students.stab.org" account, email and a unique code are stored in pending_accounts table, send confirmation email to that address
	- confirmation email POSTs code and user's email to "/confirmation"
	- at the "/confirmation" endpoint, check if there exists a row with that same unique code and same email, 
	- if so, delete that entry in pending_accounts, add new entry to users table, entering their email and setting isAdmin to false, redirect to "/login"

MUCH SIMPLER IDEA:
	- when "/signup" is gotted, we ask them to authenticate with "some" google email, which, once it has been proved real, we check to see if it is "students.stab.org", and if so, we enter them into the users table
	- in this case we don't need a confirmation email or endpoint or pending_accounts table

## Introduction

StabOverflow was created as a platform for the exchange of knowledge within the CS department. The objective was to give students more of an opportunity for their questions to be heard and answered not only by faculty but also by their peers.

The current functionality of StabOverflow includes:
- markdown editors for questions and answers (clean formatting, syntax highlighting with code)
- classification of questions based on adminstrator-determined categories
- an upvoting system to move the best answers to the top
- a fully-featured search engine with options to narrow results based on category, user, and number of answers
- user profiles
- smart authentication to limit certain functionality to St. Anne's-Belfield students only
